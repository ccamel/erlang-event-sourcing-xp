# Instructions

1. Implement the required code changes.

   - Respect OTP design principles: processes are supervised, not ad-hoc.
   - Expose behavior through well-defined message interfaces (the public API of each process must be explicit and documented).
   - Handle state exclusively inside the process loop, derived from initialization or replayed events.
   - Never persist or mutate state outside the process loop without emitting events.
   - Do not use global ETS tables, persistent_term, or external caches unless explicitly part of the storage backend abstraction.
   - Code should be self-explanatory. Avoid inline comments inside functions unless absolutely necessary for comprehension or to clarify a non-obvious decision.

2. Follow the Event Sourcing model.

   - Business actions produce domain events.
   - State is derived by folding or replaying events, not by direct mutation.
   - Storage backends are pluggable. Never assume a specific persistence mechanismâ€”use the provided abstraction layer.
   - Each aggregate or entity process must be replayable from its event history.

3. Run static checks and formatting, and fix any issue before committing:

   - Run formatter. If formatting fails, apply the formatter and rerun the checks.
   - Run lint.
   - Run the full test suite. All tests must pass.
   - Tests must be deterministic and isolated. Avoid leaking state across processes or tests. Use in-memory or mock backends when possible.

4. Update documentation when relevant.

   - If code changes affect behavior, public interfaces, supervision structure, or configuration, update the README and related docs accordingly.
   - Keep examples, API descriptions, and diagrams consistent with the current implementation.
   - Documentation is part of the system. Outdated docs are bugs.

5. Commit using Conventional Commits syntax, consistent with the existing repository history:

   - Use the correct type (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, etc.)
   - Use a clear, scoped subject line
   - Write a meaningful body when needed (focus on *why*, not just *what*)

6. If there is any doubt or open question regarding the design, supervision strategy, message protocol, event model, or storage contract, stop and ask before proceeding.
