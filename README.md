## About

I'm a big fan of [Erlang/OTP][Erlang] and [Event Sourcing], and I strongly believe that the _Actor Model_ and _Event Sourcing_ are a natural fit. This repository is my way of exploring how these two concepts can work together in practice.

As an **experiment**, this repo won't cover every facet of event sourcing in depth, but it should provide some insights and spark ideas on the potential of this approach in [Erlang].

[Event Sourcing]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing

## Features

- **Aggregate** ‚Äî a reusable [gen_server](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/gen_server.html) harness that keeps domain logic pure while delegating event sourcing boilerplate.
- **Aggregate Manager** ‚Äî a router and lifecycle supervisor that spins up aggregates on demand, rehydrates them from persisted events, and passivates idle instances.
- **Event Store** ‚Äî a behaviour-driven abstraction with drop-in backends so you can pick the storage engine that fits your deployment.
- **Snapshots** ‚Äî automatic checkpointing at configurable intervals to avoid replaying entire streams.
- **Passivation** ‚Äî idle aggregates are shut down cleanly and will rehydrate from the store on the next command.

All backends plug into the same behaviour, so switching modules only requires tweaking the aggregate manager configuration.

## Architecture

### Overview

This project is structured around the core principles of Event Sourcing:

- All changes are represented as immutable events.
- Aggregates handle commands and apply events to evolve their state.
- State is rehydrated by replaying historical events. Possible optimizations include snapshots and caching.

### Event store

The event store is a core component in this experiment, designed as a customizable `behaviour` that any `module` can implement to handle event storage. Its primary responsibilities include storing and retrieving events.

```erlang
% Initializes the event store
-callback start() -> {ok, initialized | already_initialized} | {error, term()}.

% Shuts down the event store.
-callback stop() -> {ok} | {error, term()}.

% Persists a list of events for a given stream.
-callback persist_events(StreamId, Events) -> ok | {error, term()}
    when StreamId :: stream_id(),
         Events :: [event()].

% Retrieves events from a stream and folds them using a provided function
-callback retrieve_and_fold_events(StreamId, Options, FoldFun, InitialAcc) -> {ok, Acc} | {error, term()}
    when StreamId :: stream_id(),
         Options :: fold_events_opts(),
         FoldFun :: fold_events_fun(),
         InitialAcc :: Acc.
```

#### Snapshot Support

The event store supports snapshotting to optimize aggregate rehydration. Instead of replaying all events from the beginning, aggregates can:

1. Load the latest snapshot (if available)
2. Replay only events that occurred after the snapshot
3. Automatically create new snapshots at configurable intervals

**Snapshot Callbacks:**

```erlang
% Save a snapshot of aggregate state
-callback save_snapshot(Snapshot) -> ok when Snapshot :: snapshot().

% Retrieve the latest snapshot for a stream
-callback retrieve_latest_snapshot(StreamId) -> {ok, Snapshot} | {error, not_found}.
```

The snapshot record contains all necessary fields (domain, stream_id, sequence, timestamp, state), making the API consistent with event persistence where events are passed as complete records.

**Configuring Snapshots:**

```erlang
% Start aggregate with snapshot every 10 events
event_sourcing_core_aggregate:start_link(
    Module,
    Store,
    Id,
    #{snapshot_interval => 10}
).
```

When `snapshot_interval` is set to a positive integer, a snapshot is automatically saved whenever the aggregate's sequence number is a multiple of that interval.

#### Additional future features

- Support event subscriptions for real-time updates.
- Implement snapshot retention policies (e.g., keep only last N snapshots).

#### Current Implementation

- [Mnesia](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/mnesia.html)
- [ETS](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/ets.html)

### Aggregate

The _aggregate_ is implemented as a [gen_server](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/gen_server.html) that encapsulates _domain logic_ and delegates event persistence to a pluggable Event Store (e.g. [ETS](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/ets.html) or [Mnesia](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/mnesia.html)).

The core idea is to separate concerns between domain behavior and infrastructure. To achieve this, the system is structured into three main components:

- üß© **Domain Module** ‚Äî a pure module that implements domain-specific logic via _behaviour_ callbacks.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **`aggregate`** ‚Äî the glue that bridges domain logic and infrastructure (event sourcing logic, event persistence, etc.).
- üö¶ [`gen_server`](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/gen_server.html) ‚Äî the OTP mechanism that provides lifecycle management and message orchestration.

The `aggregate` provides:

- A [behaviour](https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/design_principles.html#behaviours) for domain-specific modules to implement.
- A generic [OTP](https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/design_principles.html) [gen_server](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/gen_server.html) that:
  - Rehydrates state from events on startup (with optional snapshot loading).
  - Processes commands to produce events.
  - Applies events to evolve internal state.
  - Automatically passivates (shuts down) after inactivity.
  - Saves snapshots at configurable intervals for optimization.

The following diagram shows how the system processes a command using the event-sourced aggregate infrastructure.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant GenAggregate as aggregate
    participant GenServer as gen_server
    participant DomainModule as AggregateModule (callback)

    User ->> GenAggregate: gen_aggregate:start_link(...)
    activate GenAggregate
    GenAggregate ->>+ GenServer: gen_server:start_link(Module, State)
    GenServer ->> GenAggregate: gen_aggregate:init/1
    deactivate GenAggregate

    User ->> GenAggregate: gen_aggregate:dispatch(Pid, Command)
    activate GenAggregate
    GenAggregate ->> GenServer: gen_server:call(Pid, Command)
    GenServer ->> GenAggregate: gen_aggregate:handle_call/3

    GenAggregate ->> DomainModule: handle_command(Command, State)
    GenAggregate ->> GenAggregate: persist_events(Store, Events)

    loop For each Event
        GenAggregate ->> DomainModule: apply_event(Event, State)
    end
    deactivate GenAggregate
```

#### Passivation

Each aggregate instance (a `gen_server`) is automatically passivated ‚Äî i.e., stopped ‚Äî after a period of inactivity.

This helps:

- Free up memory in long-lived systems
- Keep the number of live processes bounded
- Rehydrate state on demand from the event store

Passivation is configured via a `timeout` value when the aggregate is started (defaults to 5000 ms):

```erlang
event_sourcing_core_aggregate:start_link(Module, Store, Id, #{timeout => 10000}).
```

When no messages are received within the timeout window:

- A passivate message is sent to the process.
- The aggregate process exits normally (`stop`).
- Its state is discarded.
- Future commands will cause the manager to rehydrate it from persisted events.

#### Snapshots

Snapshots provide a performance optimization for aggregate rehydration by avoiding the need to replay all events from the beginning of a stream.

**How it works:**

1. **On startup**, the aggregate:

   - Attempts to load the latest snapshot from the event store
   - If found, initializes state from the snapshot
   - Replays only events that occurred after the snapshot sequence

2. **During command processing**, snapshots are automatically created when:
   - A `snapshot_interval` is configured (e.g., `10`)
   - The current sequence number is a multiple of the interval
   - For example, with `snapshot_interval => 10`, snapshots are saved at sequences 10, 20, 30, etc.

**Configuration:**

```erlang
% Create aggregate with snapshots every 10 events
event_sourcing_core_aggregate:start_link(
    bank_account_aggregate,
    event_sourcing_core_store_ets,
    <<"account-123">>,
    #{
        timeout => 5000,
        snapshot_interval => 10  % Save snapshot every 10 events
    }
).
```

Setting `snapshot_interval => 0` (the default) disables automatic snapshotting.

### Aggregate Manager

The _aggregate manager_ is implemented as a [gen_server](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/gen_server.html). It serves as a router and supervisor for aggregate processes, ensuring that commands are dispatched to the correct aggregate instance based on their stream ID.

The manager is responsible for:

- Routing commands to the appropriate aggregate process.
- Managing the lifecycle of aggregate instances, starting new ones as needed.
- Monitoring aggregate processes and cleaning up when they terminate.

#### How it works

The aggregate manager maintains a mapping of stream IDs to aggregate process PIDs. When a command is received:

1. The `Router` module extracts the target aggregate type and stream ID from the command.
2. If the aggregate type matches the manager‚Äôs configured `Aggregate` module:
   - The manager checks its internal `pids` map for an existing process for the stream ID.
   - If none exists, it spawns a new `event_sourcing_core_aggregate` process using the provided Aggregate, Store, and stream ID, then monitors it.
   - The command is forwarded to the aggregate process via `event_sourcing_core_aggregate:dispatch/2`.
3. If the aggregate type mismatches or routing fails, an error is returned.

```

#### Options

The manager can be configured with options such as:

- `timeout`: Timeout for operations.
- `sequence_zero`: Function to initialize event sequences.
- `sequence_next`: Function to increment sequences.
- `now_fun`: Function to provide timestamps.

## Build

```sh
rebar3 compile
```

## Test

```sh
rebar3 eunit
```

## Lint

```sh
rebar3 do dialyzer, fmt --check
```

`dialyzer` runs the type analysis, while `fmt --check` makes sure all Erlang sources are already formatted.
