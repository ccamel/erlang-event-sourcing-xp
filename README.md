> ðŸ§ª Experimenting with Event Sourcing in Erlang

## About

I'm a big fan of [Erlang/OTP][Erlang] and [Event Sourcing], and I strongly believe that the _Actor Model_ and _Event Sourcing_ are a natural fit. This repository is my way of exploring how these two concepts can work together in practice.

As an **experiment**, this repo won't cover every facet of event sourcing in depth, but it should provide some insights and spark ideas on the potential of this approach in [Erlang].
