## About

I'm a big fan of [Erlang/OTP][Erlang] and [Event Sourcing], and I strongly believe that the _Actor Model_ and _Event Sourcing_ are a natural fit. This repository is my way of exploring how these two concepts can work together in practice.

As an **experiment**, this repo won't cover every facet of event sourcing in depth, but it should provide some insights and spark ideas on the potential of this approach in [Erlang].

## Features

- **Aggregate** ‚Äî a reusable [gen_server](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/gen_server.html) harness that keeps domain logic pure while delegating event sourcing boilerplate.
- **Aggregate Manager** ‚Äî a router and lifecycle supervisor that spins up aggregates on demand, rehydrates them from persisted events, and passivates idle instances.
- **Event Store** ‚Äî a behaviour-driven abstraction with drop-in backends so you can pick the storage engine that fits your deployment.
- **Snapshots** ‚Äî automatic checkpointing at configurable intervals to avoid replaying entire streams.
- **Passivation** ‚Äî idle aggregates are shut down cleanly and will rehydrate from the store on the next command.

## Architecture

### Overview

This project is structured around the core principles of Event Sourcing:

- All changes are represented as immutable events.
- Aggregates handle commands and apply events to evolve their state.
- State is rehydrated by replaying historical events. Possible optimizations include snapshots and caching.

### Event store

The event store is a core component in this experiment, designed as a customizable `behaviour` that any `module` can implement to handle event storage. Its primary responsibilities include storing and retrieving events.

```erlang
% Initializes the event store
-callback start() -> {ok, initialized | already_initialized} | {error, term()}.

% Shuts down the event store.
-callback stop() -> {ok} | {error, term()}.

% Persists a list of events for a given stream.
-callback persist_events(StreamId, Events) -> ok | {error, term()}
    when StreamId :: stream_id(),
         Events :: [event()].

% Retrieves events from a stream and folds them using a provided function
-callback retrieve_and_fold_events(StreamId, Options, FoldFun, InitialAcc) -> {ok, Acc} | {error, term()}
    when StreamId :: stream_id(),
         Options :: fold_events_opts(),
         FoldFun :: fold_events_fun(),
         InitialAcc :: Acc.
```

#### Snapshot Support

The event store supports snapshotting to optimize aggregate rehydration. Instead of replaying all events from the beginning, aggregates can:

1. Load the latest snapshot (if available)
2. Replay only events that occurred after the snapshot
3. Automatically create new snapshots at configurable intervals

**Snapshot Callbacks:**

```erlang
% Save a snapshot of aggregate state
-callback save_snapshot(Snapshot) -> ok when Snapshot :: snapshot().

% Retrieve the latest snapshot for a stream
-callback retrieve_latest_snapshot(StreamId) -> {ok, Snapshot} | {error, not_found}.
```

The snapshot record contains all necessary fields (domain, stream_id, sequence, timestamp, state), making the API consistent with event persistence where events are passed as complete records.

**Configuring Snapshots:**

```erlang
% Start aggregate with snapshot every 10 events
event_sourcing_core_aggregate:start_link(
    Module,
    Store,
    Id,
    #{snapshot_interval => 10}
).
```

When `snapshot_interval` is set to a positive integer, a snapshot is automatically saved whenever the aggregate's sequence number is a multiple of that interval.

#### Additional future features

- Support event subscriptions for real-time updates.
- Implement snapshot retention policies (e.g., keep only last N snapshots).

#### Current Implementation

- [Mnesia](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/mnesia.html)
- [ETS](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/ets.html)

### Aggregate

The _aggregate_ is implemented as a [gen_server](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/gen_server.html) that encapsulates _domain logic_ and delegates event persistence to a pluggable Event Store (e.g. [ETS](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/ets.html) or [Mnesia](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/mnesia.html)).

The core idea is to separate concerns between domain behavior and infrastructure. To achieve this, the system is structured into three main components:

- üß© **Domain Module** ‚Äî a pure module that implements domain-specific logic via _behaviour_ callbacks.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **`aggregate`** ‚Äî the glue that bridges domain logic and infrastructure (event sourcing logic, event persistence, etc.).
- üö¶ [`gen_server`](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/gen_server.html) ‚Äî the OTP mechanism that provides lifecycle management and message orchestration.

The `aggregate` provides:

- A [behaviour](https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/design_principles.html#behaviours) for domain-specific modules to implement.
- A generic [OTP](https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/design_principles.html) [gen_server](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/gen_server.html) that:
  - Rehydrates state from events on startup (with optional snapshot loading).
  - Processes commands to produce events.
  - Applies events to evolve internal state.
  - Automatically passivates (shuts down) after inactivity.
  - Saves snapshots at configurable intervals for optimization.

The following diagram shows how the system processes a command using the event-sourced aggregate infrastructure.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant GenAggregate as aggregate
    participant GenServer as gen_server
    participant DomainModule as AggregateModule (callback)

    User ->> GenAggregate: gen_aggregate:start_link(...)
    activate GenAggregate
    GenAggregate ->>+ GenServer: gen_server:start_link(Module, State)
    GenServer ->> GenAggregate: gen_aggregate:init/1
    deactivate GenAggregate

    User ->> GenAggregate: gen_aggregate:dispatch(Pid, Command)
    activate GenAggregate
    GenAggregate ->> GenServer: gen_server:call(Pid, Command)
    GenServer ->> GenAggregate: gen_aggregate:handle_call/3

    GenAggregate ->> DomainModule: handle_command(Command, State)
    GenAggregate ->> GenAggregate: persist_events(Store, Events)

    loop For each Event
        GenAggregate ->> DomainModule: apply_event(Event, State)
    end
    deactivate GenAggregate
```

#### Passivation

Each aggregate instance (a `gen_server`) is automatically passivated ‚Äî i.e., stopped ‚Äî after a period of inactivity.

This helps:

- Free up memory in long-lived systems
- Keep the number of live processes bounded
- Rehydrate state on demand from the event store

Passivation is configured via a `timeout` value when the aggregate is started (defaults to 5000 ms):

```erlang
event_sourcing_core_aggregate:start_link(Module, Store, Id, #{timeout => 10000}).
```

When no messages are received within the timeout window:

- A passivate message is sent to the process.
- The aggregate process exits normally (`stop`).
- Its state is discarded.
- Future commands will cause the manager to rehydrate it from persisted events.

#### Snapshots

Snapshots provide a performance optimization for aggregate rehydration by avoiding the need to replay all events from the beginning of a stream.

**How it works:**

1. **On startup**, the aggregate:

   - Attempts to load the latest snapshot from the event store
   - If found, initializes state from the snapshot
   - Replays only events that occurred after the snapshot sequence

2. **During command processing**, snapshots are automatically created when:
   - A `snapshot_interval` is configured (e.g., `10`)
   - The current sequence number is a multiple of the interval
   - For example, with `snapshot_interval => 10`, snapshots are saved at sequences 10, 20, 30, etc.

**Configuration:**

```erlang
% Create aggregate with snapshots every 10 events
event_sourcing_core_aggregate:start_link(
    bank_account_aggregate,
    event_sourcing_store_ets,
    <<"account-123">>,
    #{
        timeout => 5000,
        snapshot_interval => 10  % Save snapshot every 10 events
    }
).
```

Setting `snapshot_interval => 0` (the default) disables automatic snapshotting.

### Aggregate Manager

The _aggregate manager_ is implemented as a [gen_server](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/gen_server.html). It serves as a router and supervisor for aggregate processes, ensuring that commands are dispatched to the correct aggregate instance based on their stream ID.

The manager is responsible for:

- Routing commands to the appropriate aggregate process.
- Managing the lifecycle of aggregate instances, starting new ones as needed.
- Monitoring aggregate processes and cleaning up when they terminate.

#### How it works

The aggregate manager maintains a mapping of stream IDs to aggregate process PIDs. When a command is received:

1. The `Router` module extracts the target aggregate type and stream ID from the command.
2. If the aggregate type matches the manager‚Äôs configured `Aggregate` module:
   - The manager checks its internal `pids` map for an existing process for the stream ID.
   - If none exists, it spawns a new `event_sourcing_core_aggregate` process using the provided Aggregate, Store, and stream ID, then monitors it.
   - The command is forwarded to the aggregate process via `event_sourcing_core_aggregate:dispatch/2`.
3. If the aggregate type mismatches or routing fails, an error is returned.

```

#### Options

The manager can be configured with options such as:

- `timeout`: Timeout for operations.
- `sequence_zero`: Function to initialize event sequences.
- `sequence_next`: Function to increment sequences.
- `now_fun`: Function to provide timestamps.
