      instructions: |
        Review the Erlang source files with a focus on the project's architecture and best practices:
        - **Actor Model & Concurrency**: Ensure that OTP behaviors (e.g., `gen_server`, `gen_statem`, `gen_event`) are correctly implemented and used effectively.
        - **Event Sourcing**: Validate that event persistence and retrieval via **Mnesia** follow best practices, ensuring proper data consistency and versioning.
        - **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Check if the event-driven architecture properly separates **commands, events, and state transitions**.
        - **Code Quality and Maintainability**: Ensure idiomatic Erlang code, proper **pattern matching**, effective use of **records and maps**, and clean module organization.
        - **Performance & Scalability**: Identify bottlenecks related to **message passing, ETS/Mnesia transactions, and process spawning**. Suggest optimizations where applicable.
    - path: "**/*.hrl"
      instructions: |
        Review Erlang header files for:
        - **Type & Record Definitions**: Ensure types are well-defined and align with the domain model.
        - **Macro Usage**: Validate the necessity of macros (`-define(...)`), ensuring they are not overused where functions or constants could suffice.
        - **Cross-Module Consistency**: Check that header files are used appropriately across modules and don't introduce unnecessary dependencies.
    - path: "**/*.md"
      instructions: |
        Review markdown documentation with these guidelines:
        - **Structure**: Ensure logical organization and consistency in headings.
        - **Technical Accuracy**: Verify correctness in Erlang/Mnesia-related concepts and example code.
        - **Clarity**: Ensure content is concise, with minimal jargon, making it accessible to developers.
        - **Completeness**: Check if all key functionalities are covered and properly documented.
