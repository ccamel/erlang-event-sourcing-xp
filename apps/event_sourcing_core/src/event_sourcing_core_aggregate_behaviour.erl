-module(event_sourcing_core_aggregate_behaviour).
-moduledoc """
Defines the aggregate behaviour for event-sourced domain modules.

Modules implementing this behaviour encapsulate the pure domain logic
for handling commands and applying events. This behaviour is intended
to be used by `gen_aggregate`-based processes for executing commands,
rehydrating state from events, and projecting changes to domain state.

Implementers are responsible for:

- Initializing domain state (`init/0`)
- Handling commands and returning domain events (`handle_command/2`)
- Applying events to evolve state (`apply_event/2`)
- Identifying the event type for a payload (`event_type/1`)

Initialize the aggregate's state.

This is called once when the aggregate process is started and before
any events have been applied.

Function shall return The initial aggregate state.

Determine the event type for a given payload.

This is used internally to construct full event records
during command handling. The returned type is stored in the event store.

- Payload is the raw event payload.

Function shall return an atom representing the event type (e.g., `user_registered`).

Handle a domain command.

This function is responsible for validating and transforming a command
into one or more domain events. It receives the current state of the
aggregate and returns either:

- `{ok, [event_payload()]}` — A list of events to persist and apply.
- `{error, Reason}` — A reason for rejecting the command.

This function should be pure and side-effect free.

- Command is the incoming domain command.
- State is the current aggregate state.

Apply a domain event to the aggregate state.

This function must be deterministic and pure — given the same event and state,
it should always return the same result. It is used both during rehydration
(when replaying past events) and after handling a new command.

- State0 the current aggregate state.
